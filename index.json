[{"content":"Introduction Raw EEG signals usually have so many artifacts which makes the training of models harder. So, we are trying to transform them into GFA (Gramian Angular Field) projections and Reccurance Plots to capture the information from EEG signals and apply the method of transfer learning on models trained on the ImageNet (J. Deng et al.,2009) to classify them into tasks.\nDataset PhysioNet - EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset consists of over 1500 one- and two-minute 64-channels EEG recordings, obtained from 109 volunteers in 14 experimental runs, as described below.\nBaseline, eyes open Baseline, eyes closed Task 1 (open and close left or right fist) Task 2 (imagine opening and closing left or right fist) Task 3 (open and close both fists or both feet) Task 4 (imagine opening and closing both fists or both feet) Task 1 Task 2 Task 3 Task 4 Task 1 Task 2 Task 3 Task 4 Each run has a annotation file described as below. Each annotation includes one of three codes (T0, T1, or T2):\nT0 corresponds to rest T1 corresponds to onset of motion (real or imagined) of the left fist (in runs 3, 4, 7, 8, 11, and 12) both fists (in runs 5,6, 9, 10, 13, and 14) T2 corresponds to onset of motion (real or imagined) of the right fist (in runs 3, 4, 7, 8, 11, and 12) both feet (in runs 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, and 14) Implementation References J.
